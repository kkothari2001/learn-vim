# Week 1

## Day 1
I had some prior knowledge with vim, but only upto basic text insertion and navigation using the h,j,k,l keys. This allowed me to atleast get started with this repository with only vim/CLI.
Things I learnt:
1. Writing to a file using `:w <filename>`
2. Saving open file using `:w`
3. Quitting after saving using `:wq`
4. Quitting without saving using `:q!`
5. Simple quitting using `:q`
6. Going into insert mode with `i`
7. Going into insert mode with `a` (starts entering chars from the next charachter)
8. going into insert mode with `shift+a` (starts entering charachters from the end of the current line)

I will continue some practise with it, till I become good at typing with it easily.
